# Data-Smash-Bros-Ultimate

## Resume of the project
Me and my friends are casual players of the Super Smash Bros series and especially the 5th opus: Super Smash Bros Ultimate. In this Github repo we are trying to get the answers to an important question:  Whatâ€™s more important a good character or a great player? In the past games of the franchise, the balance between all the characters strength was extremely wrong and we would like to know if this problem has been corrected in this last opus allowing players to play any characters in equal conditions. On the way we also decided to see: What makes a character better than the others?
